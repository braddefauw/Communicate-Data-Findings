# Bay Wheels Dataset Exploration
## by Brad DeFauw


## Dataset

The dataset that I explored captures trip data for the company Bay Wheels, formerly known as Ford GoBike, a regional public bicycle sharing system in the San Francisco Bay Area, California operated by Motivate, in a partnership with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District. This dataset does an excellent job shedding light on a variety of data, including:
- Trip Duration (seconds)
- Start Time and Date
- End Time and Date
- Start Station ID
- Start Station Name
- Start Station Latitude
- Start Station Longitude
- End Station ID
- End Station Name
- End Station Latitude
- End Station Longitude
- Bike ID
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer – “Subscriber” = Member or “Customer” = Casual)
- Member Year of Birth
- Member Gender


## Summary of Findings

Through the use of Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate Explorations, I was able to come the following conclusions.

Univariate
- The majority of users are male.
- Most users are subscribers as opposed to one time customers.
- Most users were born between the years 1985 and 1990.
- Most rides lasted between 5 and 10 minutes.

Bivariate
- Most rides occurred among members over the age of 30, and lasted between 5 and 10 minutes long.
- Average ages of users are relatively consistent, with females having a slightly lower average age than those who identified as male or other gender.
- Average duration of trip across genders is largely the same, just under 10 minutes.
- Users who were one time customers seemed to take longer rides, on average, than those who are subscribers.

Multivariate
- Regardless of gender, average trip duration lasted longer for customers than it did for subscribers.
- Female data cross-referenced with age and time showed a large contingent of users around the age of 30 using the bikes for approximately 10 minutes long. This was also the largest contingent of male users, however, the male data was more spread out. For males, there were also significantly high numbers of users who were around the age of 30 and using the bike for less than 5 minutes, and also, around the age of 35 using the bikes for approximately 10 minutes.

## Key Insights for Presentation

After polishing up the data to showcase user ages without outliers, and ride lengths without outliers, as well as adjusted ride times to show ride lengths in terms of minutes versus seconds, I was most interesting in exploring how gender and age impacted ride length. I will choose these relationships to showcase in my final project.
